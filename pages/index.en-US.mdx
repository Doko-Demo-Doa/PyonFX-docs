PyonFX is a Python library that helps you combine tags, text, and shapes following the ASS format.
It also supports tasks like timecode adjustments and layering with the help of the extra data included within an ASS file.

And that's not all! PyonFX also offers some special functions to help you perform some tricky tasks,
like frame per frame operations, shape manipulation, or pixel-by-pixel effects.
This makes it much easier to create **impressive visual 2D effects**.

In comparison to other karaoke effect programs,
PyonFX is written in [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), which means that you will have all the advantages
provided by this modern scripting language which is constantly updated and perfect for both beginner and advanced users.

You can learn on how to start using the library in the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/getting-started) section.
