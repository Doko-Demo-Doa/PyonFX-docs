# Getting Started

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
First things first, you must have a good idea of how to create your effects.
You will need to learn (if you haven't already) the following:
</Callout>

- ASS format. As PyonFX is an advanced tool for typesetting and karaoke,
  it is meant to be used by experienced typesetters who are familiar with the tags Libass supports,
  as well as how they function. Check the footnote 1 for a complete list of tags.
- Python3 scripting language. A programming language like Python allows you to define a set of instructions
  to be executed by your computer. Compared to softwares with GUI it gives you much more freedom,
  as you aren't tied to buttons or sliders. You only need to know the basics for this module.
  Knowledge on how to use variable, functions, conditions, loops, comparisons, string formatting,
  lists, and dictionaries is more than enough. You can find a link to some good tutorials in the footnotes.

To use PyonFX, you'll have to write a Python3 script.
Within it you will fully define the process of your KFX or advanced typesetting creation.

## Installation

## Installation - Optional Step

This step is not mandatory to start working with the library,
but I personally consider Aegisub to be quite old and heavy, so I needed a more comfortable work setup.

That's why **PyonFX** integrates an additional way to reproduce your works in softsub faster after each generation,
using the [MPV player](https://mpv.io/). Installing it should be enough to make everything work if you're not on Windows.

If you're on Windows, you will need to add it to PATH after downloading it so the library will be able to utilize it.
There are several guides for that, like [this one](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

You need to add the folder that contains the .exe of mpv, generally `C:\Program Files\mpv`.
